Added get_fun_ptr_from_attr. See a use of it in test4.c.

Added a call to a method with two arguments to test4.c.

create_xxx and inject_xxx can now both be used with boxing or tagging runtime
implementations. create_xxx now calls inject_xxx, which does boxing or tagging
depending on if RTFLAGS=-DTAGGING is passed to make.

Changed project_int to coerce bools and floats to ints.
Changed project_bool to coerce ints and floats to bools.
Changed project_float to coerce ints and bools to floats.
